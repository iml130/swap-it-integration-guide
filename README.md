# SWAP-IT: Scalable and lightweight architecture for production - in the context of - Industry 4.0

This repository contains the integration guide, a supplement for the paper "SWAP-IT: **S**calable and light**w**eight **a**rchitecture for **p**roduction - in the context of - **I**ndus**t**ry 4.0" that was published at the IEEE 18th International Conference on Automation Science and Engineering (CASE). 
We refer to the paper for a full explanation.

## Abstract 
In recent years, various abstract and practical architectures have been proposed in the context of Industry 4.0.
While these architectures focus on different aspects, their common goal is to facilitate the transformation of a static production into a flexible, resilient, interconnected cyber-physical production system (CPPS). 
However, reviewing those reveals that a general procedure for applying those architectures is missing. 
In this paper, we propose a modular,scalable and lightweight architecture utilizing simplified semantic information models. We also present an integration
guide that helps factory owners and process engineers to apply the proposed architecture.
Furthermore, we also show how the factory operators can make architectural decisions according to their needs.
This approach will help speed up the application of the architecture for the realization of a modular and scalable CPPS.
